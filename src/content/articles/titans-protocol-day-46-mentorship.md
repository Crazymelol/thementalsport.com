**Feynman's Technique:**
You don't truly understand a concept until you can explain it to a 5-year-old.

Mentoring a rookie isn't charity. It is selfish (in a good way).
When you have to explain *why* you stepped left instead of right, you force your subconscious to become conscious. You deepen your own mastery.

**The Protocol:**
Pick one younger athlete.
Once a week, give them one specific piece of feedback.
Watch them grow.
This is how dynasties are built.
