You’ve practiced this move a thousand times. You can do it in your sleep. But today—with the crowd watching and the clock ticking—you freeze. Your legs feel like cement. Your mind goes blank.

You just choked.

But here is the good news: **You aren't a coward. You are biology.**

## The Tiger in the Room

When you step onto the field, your brain’s threat detection center (the **Amygdala**) scans for danger. In the wild, "danger" meant a tiger. In sports, "danger" means humiliation, losing, or disappointing your team.

Your brain doesn't know the difference. It dumps **cortisol** and **adrenaline** into your blood to help you fight the tiger. 

*   **Heart rate spikes** (to pump blood to muscles).
*   **Vision tunnels** (to focus on the threat).
*   **Fine motor skills shut down** (because you don't need fine motor skills to punch a tiger).

This is why you can run fast (gross motor skill) but can't sink a putt (fine motor skill).

## The GSP Protocol: "Fear is Fuel"

Georges St-Pierre (GSP) is one of the greatest MMA fighters of all time. He was also terrified. He admitted to vomiting before fights and fearing humiliation.

But GSP had a secret weapon. He didn't try to *stop* the fear. He **reframed** it.

### The Reframe
Instead of saying *"I'm scared,"* GSP told himself:
> *"My body is powering up. This shaking? That's the engine starting. This nausea? That's the fuel injection."*

He treated the cortisol dump as a **performance enhancer**, not a flaw.

## Action Step: The 3-Second Label

Next time you feel the jitters:
1.  **Feel it:** Don't fight the shaking.
2.  **Label it:** Say out loud, *"I am excited."* (Biological anxiety and excitement are almost identical).
3.  **Use it:** Visualize that energy flowing into your legs for explosion.

**Tomorrow:** We talk about the "Contract" that Kobe Bryant signed with himself.
