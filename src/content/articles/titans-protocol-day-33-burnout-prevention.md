You start the season on fire. You end the season dragging your body to the gym.
That is the Amateur Cycle.

**Burnout Mechanics:**
Burnout is not caused by "High Volume." Elite athletes train 6 hours a day for 10 years without burning out.
Burnout is caused by **Low Autonomy.**
When you feel like you *have* to do it, rather than you *choose* to do it.

## The Micro-Quit

Before you Quit the sport, you Micro-Quit 100 times.
*   Cutting a rep short.
*   Skipping the cool-down.
*   Checking your phone during rest sets.

These are Red Flags. Your brain is trying to escape.

**The Fix: Deload Weeks**
You cannot sprint a marathon.
Every 4th week, reduce volume by 40%. You don't lose fitness; you gain sanity.
