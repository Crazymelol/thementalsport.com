The game is over.
If you won, you think you're perfect. If you lost, you think you're trash.
Both are lies.

You need to separate **Performance** from **Result.**
*   You can play terrible and win (Lucky).
*   You can play perfect and lose (Unlucky).
We want to replicate the Performance, not just the Result.

## The "Good, Bad, Ugly" Framework

Write this down 24 hours after the game (not immediately).

1.  **The Good (Sustain):** What did I do well? (e.g., *"My spacing was perfect."*) -> **Action:** Keep doing this.
2.  **The Bad (Improve):** What was mediocre? (e.g., *"My cardio faded in the 4th quarter."*) -> **Action:** Add sprints to Tuesday practice.
3.  **The Ugly (Fix):** What was a disaster? (e.g., *"I lost my temper at the ref."*) -> **Action:** Stoicism drills (Day 27).

Be a scientist. Be cold. Data doesn't have feelings.
