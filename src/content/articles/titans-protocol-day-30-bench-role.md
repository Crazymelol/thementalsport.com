"The bench is a cancer or a cure."
If you sit there pouting, arms crossed, mad at the coach, you are poisoning the team. And the coach sees it. And that is why you stay on the bench.

## The Energy Giver

Be the best hype-man in the league.
*   Celebrate every point your teammates score.
*   Call out screens/dangers (you have a better view than them).
*   Hand them water during timeouts.

**Why?**
1.  **Karma:** Being a good teammate makes people want you to succeed.
2.  **Focus:** If you are engaged in the game, you are "warm." If the coach calls your name, you are mentally ready. If you are pouting, you are cold and will play terrible.

## The "Next Play" Mindset

Use the bench time to study the opponent.
*"Number 4 always goes left."*
*"Their defense is leaving the corner open."*
Find the weakness. So when you get your 2 minutes of playing time, you exploit it immediately.
