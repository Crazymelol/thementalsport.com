I see this tragedy constantly:
An athlete looks *amazing* on Tuesday practice. They go hard again on Wednesday. They grind on Thursday.
On Saturday (Game Day), they are flat. Slow. Heavy.

They left their best performance in the practice room.

## The Art of Peaking

**Tapering** is the strategic reduction of physical volume to allow fatigue to dissipate while fitness remains.
*   **Fitness** = Stable.
*   **Fatigue** = Drops fast.
*   **Performance** = Skyrockets.

## The 7-Day Protocol

You cannot cram for a competition like a test. You need to land the plane smoothly.

*   **7 Days Out:** High Intensity, Normal Volume. (Last real workout).
*   **5 Days Out:** High Intensity, 70% Volume.
*   **3 Days Out:** Moderate Intensity, 50% Volume. (Sharpening).
*   **1 Day Out:** **Priming.** Light sweat, fast twitch activators, neural wake-up. No fatigue.

## Action Step: Trust the Rest

The hardest part of Tapering is the psychology. You will feel "lazy." You will think you are losing fitness. Your anxiety will say *"Do more reps!"*

**Ignore it.**
You cannot get fitter in 3 days. But you *can* get more tired.
Trust the work you did last month. Rest the body. Sharpen the mind.

**Tomorrow:** The Final Lesson. The New Standard.
