"I just want what's best for you."
This is the most dangerous sentence in youth sports.

Parents, agents, and media often love you to death. They add pressure because they care (or because they want money).
But pressure is pressure.

## The Boundary Protocol

You must train your entourage just like you train your body.
**The "Car Ride Home" Rule:**
*   **The Problem:** The car ride home is where confidence dies. The parent analyzes every mistake.
*   **The Solution:** Set the rule. *"Mom/Dad, I love you. But for 2 hours after the game, we do not talk about the game. We can talk about dinner. We can talk about movies. But no game talk."*

If they break the rule, you put headphones on.
You must protect your mental space aggressively.
