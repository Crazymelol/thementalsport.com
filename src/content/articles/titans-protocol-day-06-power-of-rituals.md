Superstitions are for gamblers. **Rituals** are for professionals.

*   **Serena Williams** bounces the ball exactly 5 times before a first serve, and 2 times before a second serve.
*   **Rafael Nadal** aligns his water bottles with laser precision and executes a specific sequence of touches (hair, shirt, shorts) before every point.

Why? Are they OCD? Maybe. But functionally, they are **Anchoring**.

## Control in Chaos

Sports are chaotic. The crowd screams, the opponent cheats, the wind blows. You control none of it.

But you control the bounce of the ball. You control the placement of the bottle.

By performing a ritual, you tell your brain: *"I am in control here. We are safe. We are ready."* It is a psychological safe space that travels with you.

## The Trigger

A ritual also acts as a **Trigger**. It’s like clicking "Save" on a document. It separates the last play from the next play.

*   *Did you just double fault?* Do the ritual. Reset.
*   *Did you just hit an ace?* Do the ritual. Reset.

Consistent routine = Consistent performance.

## Action Step: Design Your Anchor

Build a 3-step micro-ritual you can do in 5 seconds.

1.  **Physical:** Wipe your shoes, tap your thigh, spin the racket.
2.  **Visual:** Look at a specific spot (the rim, the logo on your bat).
3.  **Verbal:** Take a breath and say "Next."

Do it every single time you reset. Make it automatic.
