Caffeine blocks Adenosine (the molecule that makes you tired). It does not "give" energy; it "borrows" it.
Ideally, we want that loan to hit exactly when the whistle blows.

**Pharmacokinetics:**
*   **Onset:** 15-20 minutes.
*   **Peak Plasma Levels:** 45-60 minutes.
*   **Half-Life:** 5-6 hours.

**The Protocol:**
1.  **Stop:** No caffeine 7 days before the event (Resensitization).
2.  **Load:** Take 3-6mg per kg of bodyweight exactly 60 minutes before start time.
3.  **Source:** Pill or Black Coffee. No sugar (sugar crash kills the buzz).

This turns Caffeine from a habit into a weapon.
