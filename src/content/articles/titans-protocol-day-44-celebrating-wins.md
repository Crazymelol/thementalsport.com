"Success is a lousy teacher. It seduces smart people into thinking they can't lose." — Bill Gates.

When you win, your ego inflates. You stop watching film. You skip the ice bath. You think you have "arrived."
**The mountain has no top.**
The moment you stop climbing, you start sliding.

**The "Midnight Rule":**
You are the Champion until midnight.
At 12:01 AM, you are 0-0. You are nobody. You have to earn it all over again.

Enjoy the trophy. Take the picture. But don't sleep with the medal.
