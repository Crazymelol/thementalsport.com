You can drill parries until your arm falls off. You can have the fastest lunge in the club. But if your mind is weak, you will lose to a lesser fencer every single time.

I’ve seen it happen in national finals, and I’ve seen it happen in practice bouts. The moment hesitation creeps in, the touch is already lost.

## The "Zero-Hesitation" Rule

In fencing, the gap between "seeing" the opening and "hitting" the target must be zero. Hesitation is the enemy. It is the split second where your brain asks, *"Is this the right move?"*

The best fencers don't ask. They act.

### How to Train It

1.  **Visualization**: Before you sleep, visualize your favorite action (e.g., Parry 4, Riposte). Visualize it working perfectly. Do this 50 times.
2.  **Trigger Words**: Assign a single word to your action. When you see the opening, scream the word in your head (e.g., "GO!"). This bypasses the analytical brain.

## Dominating the "En Garde" Line

The bout starts before the referee says "Allez". It starts when you hook up to the reel.

Look at your opponent. Are they fidgeting? Are they checking their weapon excessively? They are nervous. You are a predator. Stand still. Breathe through your nose. Project absolute calm.

> "The strip is a mirror. If you are chaotic inside, your fencing will be chaotic. If you are still, you become dangerous."

## Recovery from a Bad Touch

You just got hit with a simple attack you should have parried. You are angry. Good. But do not let that anger make you stiff.

Use the **"3-Second Rule"**:
1.  **Acknowledge**: "That was sloppy."
2.  **Reset**: Fix your mask. Take a deep breath.
3.  **Engage**: Step back to the line with a new plan.

If you carry the last touch into the next touch, you will lose both.

**Master your mind, and the medals will follow.**
