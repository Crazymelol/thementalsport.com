Positive visualization is great. But have you ever tried **Negative Visualization**?

In the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Michael Phelps dove into the pool for the 200m Butterfly final. Immediately, his goggles filled with water. He was blind.

Panic?
No.

He had visualized this exact scenario. He knew exactly how many strokes it took to reach the wall. He swam blind, relied on his stroke count, and won Gold (and broke a World Record).

## The Fragility of Optimism

If you only visualize perfect conditions, you become **fragile**.
*   You visualize a sunny day -> It rains -> You panic.
*   You visualize a perfect start -> You stumble -> You panic.

Resilience comes from preparing for the chaos.

## The Disaster Drill

The best in the world don't hope for the best; they plan for the worst. This is Stoicism 101.

By mentally rehearsing the worst-case scenarios, you rob them of their power. When the bad thing happens, your brain says: *"Oh, I've seen this before. I know what to do."*

## Action Step: The "What If" List

Write down 3 things that could go wrong in your next competition:
1.  *What if the ref makes a bad call?*
2.  *What if my equipment breaks?*
3.  *What if I fall down?*

Next to each, write your response:
1.  *Ref bad call -> I smile and refocus.*
2.  *Equipment break -> Reference the spare I packed.*
3.  *Fall down -> Get up in < 1 second.*

Do not fear the disaster. Rehearse the recovery.

**Tomorrow:** The "Remote Control" for your nervous system (Breathing).
