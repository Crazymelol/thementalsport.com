The biggest opponent isn't the other team. It's the airplane.
Flying is a hypoxic (low oxygen), low-humidity environment that radiates you and disrupts your hormones.

If you land and try to compete, you are operating at 80%.

## The Anti-Jet Lag Protocol

**1. Fasting on the Plane**
Digestion requires energy and biological rhythm. When you eat at 30,000 feet at 2 AM, your body gets confused.
*   **Rule:** Fast during the flight (Water and Electrolytes only).
*   **Break Fast:** Eat a high-protein meal strictly at **local breakfast time** upon landing. This resets the liver clock.

**2. Sunlight Anchoring**
Your Circadian Rhythm is set by light entering the eyes.
*   **Landing AM:** Get outside immediately. No sunglasses. Maximize sun exposure.
*   **Landing PM:** Wear Blue Light Blocking glasses immediately. Take Melatonin. Force the darkness.

**3. Compression**
Blood pools in the legs during flights. This creates "Cankles" and heavy legs.
*   **Wear medical-grade compression socks.** Not "tight socks." Real compression.
