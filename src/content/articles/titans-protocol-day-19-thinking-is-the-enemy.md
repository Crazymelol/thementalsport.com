The alarm goes off.
This is the moment most athletes dread.
The eyes open. The heart rate spikes immediately. The stomach churns. The "What if?" thoughts flood the brain like a tidal wave.

**Stop.**
Do not lie in bed thinking. Thinking is the enemy.
**Move.**

## The Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR)

Biology is clockwork.
Within 30-45 minutes of waking up, your body naturally releases a massive surge of cortisol. This is known as the **Cortisol Awakening Response (CAR).**
In normal life, this wakes you up. On race day, combined with your anxiety, it feels like a panic attack.

We want to harness this, not fight it. We want to convert that chemical energy from "Anxiety" into "Alertness."

## The Wake-Up Protocol

**Step 1: Feet on Floor (T-Minus 5 Seconds)**
The longer you lie in bed, the more time your Prefrontal Cortex has to construct "Disaster Scenarios."
*   **Rule:** Less than 60 seconds from alarm to vertical.
*   **Action:** Stand up. Walk to the bathroom.

**Step 2: Photon Blast (T-Minus 2 Minutes)**
Light is a drug. When photons hit the retina, they signal the Suprachiasmatic Nucleus (your master clock) that it is "Game Time."
*   **Action:** Open the curtains immediately. If it's dark, turn on every light in the room. Wearing sunglasses inside on race morning is strictly forbidden. We want maximum lux.

**Step 3: Hydrotherapy / The Cold Shock (T-Minus 15 Minutes)**
You don't need a fancy ice bath. You just need a shower.
*   **The Protocol:** Take your normal warm shower to loosen the muscles.
*   **The Finish:** Turn the water to **COLD** for the final 30-60 seconds.
*   **The Science:** This prompts a massive release of Norepinephrine into the brain. It clears the "brain fog" instantly. It forces you to gasp (deep breathing). It primes the Central Nervous System for battle.

## The Fueling Window

**The Caffeine Rule**
Caffeine is a powerful ergogenic aid. But it has a half-life of 6 hours and peak absorption at 45-60 minutes.
*   **Mistake:** Drinking coffee 4 hours before the race. The effect will wear off by start time, leaving you with the "crash."
*   **Protocol:** Save the caffeine for T-Minus 60 minutes (The Priming Window).
