*"I am the greatest! I said that even before I knew I was."* — Muhammad Ali.

Read that again. **"Before I knew I was."**

Most people wait for evidence to believe in themselves.
*   "I'll believe I'm a winner when I win a trophy."
*   "I'll be confident when I make the team."

Muhammad Ali did it backward. He believed it *first*, and the reality followed.

## Your Internal Radio Station

Your brain is constantly running a commentary track. For most athletes, it's Radio Doubt:
*   *"Don't mess up."*
*   *"They are bigger than me."*
*   *"I hope I don't choke."*

Your subconscious mind doesn't judge—it just obeys. If you feed it fear, it gives you hesitation. If you feed it dominance, it gives you power.

## The "Future Truth" Technique

Ali didn't just use positive thinking; he used **Future Truth**. He spoke about his victory in the present tense, as if it had already happened.

He repeated it until his neurology accepted it as a fact. By the time he stepped in the ring, he wasn't trying to win; he was just fulfilling a prophecy.

## Action Step: Script Your Headline

Imagine tomorrow's newspaper headline about your next game. What does it say?

*   *"Smith Dominates Defense with Relentless Pressure"*
*   *"Jones Scoring Streak Continues"*

Turn that headline into an **"I Am"** statement.
> *"I am relentless pressure."*

Repeat it 10 times in the mirror every morning. Ideally, scream it in your car on the way to practice. Make your subconscious believe it.
