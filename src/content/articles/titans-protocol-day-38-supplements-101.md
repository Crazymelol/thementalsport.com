Walk into GNC and you will see a wall of lies.
"Fat Burners." "Testosterone Boosters." Garbage.

If you are an athlete, there are only 3 supplements (besides Caffeine) that are Tier 1 (Proven Effective):

**1. Creatine Monohydrate**
*   **What it does:** Increases Phosphocreatine stores (explosive energy for 0-10 seocnds).
*   **Dose:** 5g daily. Forever. It is the most researched sports supplement in history. It is safe. It works.

**2. Beta-Alanine**
*   **What it does:** Buffers acid in the muscles. Delays the "burn."
*   **Dose:** 3-6g daily. (Yes, it makes your skin tingle. That's paresthesia. It's harmless).

**3. Vitamin D3**
*   **What it does:** Actually a hormone. Critical for muscle function and testosterone.
*   **Dose:** Most athletes are deficient. Get bloodwork. Supplement accordingly.
