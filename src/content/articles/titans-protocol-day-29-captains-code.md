The All Blacks (New Zealand Rugby) are the most dominant team in history.
Their Captains—the superstars—are the ones who clean the locker room after the game.
They call it **"Sweeping the Sheds."**

## Servant Leadership

If you want to lead, you must serve.
*   Don't be the guy yelling instructions. Be the guy carrying the heavy equipment bag.
*   Don't blame your teammates for a loss. Take the blame yourself.
*   Don't take credit for the win. Give the credit to the team.

## The Body Language of a Leader

When the team is down by 10 points, everyone looks at the Captain.
If you are looking at the ground, the game is over.
*   **Chin Up:** Physically lift your head.
*   **Chest Out:** Open posture (confidence).
*   **Touch:** High-five or pat every single teammate. Physical touch reduces cortisol in the group.
