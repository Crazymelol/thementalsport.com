Athletes die twice.
The first time is when they retire.

To survive the first death, you must build something that lasts longer than your knees.
**Your Legacy is not your Trophy Case.**
Your Legacy is the *Culture* you leave behind.

*   Did you teach the rookies how to be professionals?
*   Did you change the standard of training for the program?
*   Did you treat the staff with respect?

The records will be broken. The stories will remain. Write a good story.
