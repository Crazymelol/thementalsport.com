The principles in this series are not about sports.
They are about **Human Performance.**
The biology of a sprinter in the blocks is identical to the biology of a CEO walking onto a stage, or a surgeon picking up a scalpel.
Cortisol is Cortisol. Focus is Focus.

## The Boardroom Athlete

Most business people are "Amateurs."
They rely on coffee and deadline-panic to get work done. They answer emails reactively. They have no taper, no warm-up, and no recovery.
They burn out.

**Applying the Protocol to Business:**

**1. The Meeting Taper**
If you have a career-defining presentation on Friday:
*   Do not stay up until 3 AM Thursday making slides. That is the "Panic Train."
*   **SOP:** The slides must be done 48 hours in advance. Thursday is for light review (Mental Mapping) and sleep.

**2. The Anchor Trigger for Public Speaking**
Public speaking is the #1 fear for most humans.
*   **Warm-Up:** Go to the bathroom 5 mins before. Do some air squats (flush the cortisol).
*   **Trigger:** Squeeze your thumb and forefinger together hard. Breathe.
*   **First 60 Seconds:** Have your opening line memorized perfectly. Do not "wing" the intro. Automated execution.

**3. The Deep Work Machine**
Use the "Zero-Option" policy for your workday.
*   Remove the phone.
*   Script the first 2 hours of the day.
*   Do not negotiate with yourself about checking email.
