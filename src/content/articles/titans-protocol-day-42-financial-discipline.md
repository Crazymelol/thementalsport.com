If you are worried about rent, you cannot focus on your jump shot.
Financial Stress is a massive cortisol spike. It forces you to take bad sponsorship deals. It forces you to play injured because you need the game check.

**The "Runway" Concept:**
You need a "Runway" of 6 months of expenses in the bank.
This is your "F*** You Money."
If a coach tries to force you to play injured, you can say No. Because you aren't desperate.

**Invest in Yourself:**
The best asset you own is your body.
*   $200 on sneakers isn't spending; it's equipment.
*   $200 on bottle service is burning money.
Know the difference.
