*The Zone. The Flow. Unconscious Competence.*
It feels effortless. Time slows down.

You don't wait for Flow. You hunt it.
Steven Kotler identified 17 triggers. Here are the top 3 for athletes:

**1. High Consequence (Risk)**
Flow follows Focus. Focus follows Risk.
If there is no danger (physical or social), the brain naps.
*   **Action:** Put something on the line in practice. Bet 50 pushups.

**2. Immediate Feedback**
You need to know *instantly* if you are right or wrong.
*   **Action:** Don't just "shoot around." Shoot for a specific spot on the rim. Hit/Miss. Data.

**3. The Challenge/Skills Ratio**
*   Too easy = Boredom.
*   Too hard = Anxiety.
*   **The Sweet Spot:** 4% harder than your current skill level. This is the "Stretch Zone."
