A hotel room is a chaotic environment.
The AC is too loud (or not cold enough). The hallway light creeps under the door. The pillow is too soft.
To sleep like a beast, you must **colonize** the room.

## The Toolkit

You must bring your **Sleep Kit**:
1.  **Painter's Tape / Electrical Tape:** Cover every single LED light (TV standby light, smoke detector blinker, thermostat glow). Hotels are light pollution.
2.  **Bulldog Clip:** Use it to clip the curtains shut so that sliver of sunlight doesn't wake you up at 6 AM.
3.  **Earplugs (Wax):** Foam earplugs fall out. Wax earplugs mold to your ear. Block the elevator noise.

## The "Home Base" Setup

Do not live out of your suitcase. It creates visual clutter and stress.
*   Unpack immediately.
*   Put your toothbrush in the bathroom.
*   Set up your "Charging Station" (Phone, Watch, Headphones).
*   Make the room yours.

When the room feels organized, your brain feels organized. Chaos in the room = Chaos in the mind.
