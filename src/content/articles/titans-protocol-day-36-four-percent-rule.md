If you leave practice feeling good because you "didn't make any mistakes," you wasted your time.
Zero mistakes means you practiced what you already know.

**The 85% Rule:**
A study titled *The Eighty Five Percent Rule for Optimal Learning* shows that the fastest rate of learning happens when you succeed 85% of the time and fail 15% of the time.

*   If you fail 50% of the time, you quit (too hard).
*   If you fail 0% of the time, you stagnate (too easy).
*   **Action:** Adjust the difficulty until you are failing 1 out of every 6 reps. That is the biological signal for Neuroplasticity (Brain Growth).
