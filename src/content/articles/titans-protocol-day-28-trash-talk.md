Trash talk is an attempt to hijack your **Attentional Focus.**
The opponent wants you thinking about *them*, not the ball.

## Defense: Due Diligence

If someone trash talks you, it is a compliment. It means they are afraid. They know they can't beat you on skill alone, so they are trying to cheat.
*   **The Response:** Silence.
*   Do not look at them. Look *through* them. Treat them like a ghost.
*   Nothing infuriates a trash talker more than being ignored. It makes them feel small.

## Offense: The Smiling Assassin

You don't need to say "Your mom..." to trash talk.
The best trash talk is **Evidence.**
*   Score on them.
*   Look at them.
*   Smile.
*   Run back to defense.

This says: *"You are so easy, this is fun for me."*
That destroys their soul.
