Ted Lasso was right.
The happiest animal on earth is a goldfish. Why? It has a 10-second memory.

**The "Flush" Ritual:**
When you make a mistake (throw an interception, miss a lift), you have 10 seconds to feel bad.
Then, you must flush it.

*   **Physical Flush:** Make a "flushing" motion with your hand (like a toilet handle).
*   **Visual Flush:** Visualize the mistake swirling down the drain.
*   **Verbal:** Say *"Next."*

If you carry the last play into the next play, you will lose twice.
