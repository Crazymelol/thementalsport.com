You can survive 3 weeks without food. You can survive 3 days without water.
But high performance? You can't survive 30 minutes.

A loss of just **2% body weight** due to dehydration causes a noticeable drop in cognitive function and physical output.
*   **The Symptom:** It doesn't feel like "thirst." It feels like "fatigue." It feels like your legs are heavy and your decision-making is slow.

## The Sodium Pump

Most athletes drink too much plain water.
When you sweat, you lose salt. If you replace that sweat with plain water, you dilute your blood sodium.
This leads to **Hyponatremia.** Your brain swells. You get headaches. You feel weak.

**The Solution:**
You need **Electrolytes** (Sodium, Potassium, Magnesium).
*   **SOP:** Add a pinch of sea salt to your water bottle every morning.
*   **The Race Mix:** Use a dedicated electrolyte powder (LMNT, Liquid IV, etc.) during intense sessions.

## Calculating Sweat Rate

You need to know your burn rate.
1.  Weigh yourself naked before a 1-hour run/practice.
2.  Do the workout (do not drink anything).
3.  Weigh yourself naked after.
4.  The difference (e.g., 1.5 lbs) is your hour sweat rate. Only replace what you lose.
