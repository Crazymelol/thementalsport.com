There is no "Off" Season. There is only "Competition Season" and "Preparation Season."
If you treat the Off-Season as a vacation, you will spend the first 3 months of the regular season trying to catch up.

## The 80/20 Rule

*   **In-Season:** 80% Performance, 20% Skill Acquisition.
*   **Off-Season:** 80% Skill Acquisition, 20% Performance.

This is the time to break your swing. This is the time to change your shooting form.
You cannot fix mechanics while trying to win games. You fix mechanics in the dark.

**The Contract:**
Sign a contract with yourself for the Off-Season.
*"I will return 10lbs heavier/lighter."*
*"I will fix my left hand."*
Come back a different player.
