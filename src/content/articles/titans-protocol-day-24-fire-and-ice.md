Pain is information. Inflammation is a tool.
But chronic inflammation is the enemy.

To flush the system, we use **Contrast Therapy.** The rapid switching between vasodilation (Heat) and vasoconstriction (Cold).

## The Heat (Sauna)
*   **Duration:** 20 Minutes @ 180°F+.
*   **Effect:** Increases Heat Shock Proteins (HSP). These proteins repair damaged cells and fold proteins correctly. It mimics a fever, boosting the immune system.

## The Cold (Ice Bath / Shower)
*   **Duration:** 3 Minutes @ <50°F.
*   **Effect:** Massive Norepinephrine release (Focus). Reduces swelling. Dumps metabolic waste from muscles.

## The Protocol: The 3:1 Ratio
After a heavy training block:
1.  Sauna (15 mins).
2.  Cold Plunge (3 mins).
3.  Sauna (15 mins).
4.  Cold Plunge (3 mins).
5.  **End on Cold.** (Why? Because if you end on warm, inflammation creeps back in. End cold to seal the system).
