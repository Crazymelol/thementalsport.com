Why is a practice penalty kick easy, but a championship penalty kick hard?
The mechanics are identical. The distance is identical.
The difference is **Consequence.**

But what is the consequence? Death? No.
The consequence is **Social Shame.**

**The Spotlight Effect:**
You think everyone is watching you. You think if you miss, everyone will talk about it for years.
**Reality Check:** People are selfish. If you miss, they will talk about it for 10 minutes, and then go back to worrying about their own problems.

No one cares about your failure as much as you do.
Once you realize you are not the main character in everyone else's movie, you become free.
