**T-Minus 24 Hours.**
The training is done. The bag is packed. Now, we turn our attention to the machine itself.
Your body is a chemistry set. If you mix the wrong chemicals today, you will get an explosion (or a fizzle) tomorrow.

This guide is not a cookbook. It is a manual for **Metabolic Management.**

## The Glycogen Protocol (Fuel Tanks)

You have heard of "Carb Loading." Most people do this wrong. They eat a massive bowl of pasta the night before, wake up feeling bloated and heavy, and wonder why they feel sluggish.
**Glycogen** is stored carbohydrate in the muscles and liver. It is your primary fuel source for high-intensity effort.

**The Golden Rule:** It takes 24-48 hours to top off glycogen stores.
Stuffing your face at 8:00 PM on Friday does very little for a Saturday morning race, other than spike your insulin and disrupt your sleep.

**The Solution: The Slow Drip.**
*   Start increasing carb intake slightly at lunch on the *day before*.
*   **The Dinner:** This is the most critical meal. It must be **Boring.**
    *   **High Carb:** White rice, potatoes, quinoa, oats.
    *   **Moderate Protein:** Chicken, white fish, tofu.
    *   **Low Fat:** Fat slows digestion. We want the fuel in the muscle, not sitting in the stomach.
    *   **Low Fiber:** This is not the time for a giant kale salad. Fiber creates bulk and gas. We want an empty gut on race morning.

## Hydration: The Hidden Variable

Being just 2% dehydrated reduces physical performance by up to 10%.
But hydration is not just "Water." It is **Water + Electrolytes.**

If you drink plain water without sodium, two things happen:
1.  **Hyponatremia:** You dilute your blood sodium levels (dangerous).
2.  **Diuresis:** Your body senses the dilution and makes you pee it all out to restore balance.

**The Sponge Analogy:**
Think of your muscles like a sponge. If you pour water on a dry sponge, it runs off. If you add salt (electrolytes), the sponge absorbs the water and holds it.
*   **Protocol:** Sip electrolyte-enhanced water throughout the day.
*   **The Pee Test:** Your urine should be "Lemonade," not "Apple Juice" (too dehydrated) and not "Clear Water" (over-hydrated).

## The Gut-Brain Axis (The Nervous Stomach)

Why do you get butterflies? Why do athletes vomit before big games?
Because your stomach has a "second brain" called the **Enteric Nervous System (ENS).**
When you get nervous (High Arousal), your brain sends a signal: *"Threat Detected. Divert blood away from stomach to the legs."*
Digestion stops. Food sits there like a rock. Nausea sets in.

**How to Hack the Gut:**
*   **Liquid Calories:** If you are too nervous to eat solid food on race morning, switch to liquid (smoothies, Ensure, sports drinks). Liquid destroys gastric barriers faster.
*   **The Comfort Meal:** Pick one meal that you *know* makes you feel good. Eat that. Every time. It’s a psychological anchor as much as a physiological one.
