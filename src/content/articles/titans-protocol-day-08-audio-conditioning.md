Michael Phelps walked out to the pool deck wearing massive headphones. It became an iconic look. But he wasn't just blocking out noise—he was **dosing his brain**.

Music directly impacts your arousal levels (The Yerkes-Dodson Law).
*   **High BPM (Beats Per Minute)** = Increases heart rate, adrenaline.
*   **Low BPM** = Lowers cortisol, induces calm.

## No Shuffle Mode

Amateurs put their playlist on Shuffle. One minute it's heavy metal, the next it's a sad breakup ballad. This gives you emotional whiplash.

Pros curate the chemicals.

*   **Phelps:** Listened to Eminem and aggressive hip-hop to get angry and aggressive before a race.
*   **Bolt:** Often listened to reggae and dancehall to stay loose and relaxed.

## Action Step: The Two Playlists

You need two specific tools in your phone:

### 1. The "Viking Mode" Playlist (Ramp Up)
**Purpose:** Use when you are tired, sluggish, or need to hit a PR.
**Content:** Aggressive, fast, heavy bass. Songs that make you want to enforce your will on the world.

### 2. The "Zen Mode" Playlist (Cool Down)
**Purpose:** Use when you are jittery, anxious, or over-hyped.
**Content:** Lo-fi, classical, acoustic, or specific frequencies (432Hz). Songs that slow your breathing.

**The Rule:** never listen to Viking Mode when you are sitting on the bus 3 hours before the game. You'll burn out. Save the dose for 20 minutes prior.
