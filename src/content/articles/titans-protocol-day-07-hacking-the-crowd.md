Everyone loves Roger Federer. Everyone loves Rafa Nadal.
Novak Djokovic? He is often the villain.

At Wimbledon, facing Federer, the entire stadium—15,000 people—chanted *"Roger! Roger!"*

For most players, this is crushing. It feels like the world is against you. You get angry. You lose focus.

## The Mental Hack

Djokovic didn't fight the crowd. He didn't plug his ears. He **reframed reality.**

> *"When the crowd is chanting 'Roger', I hear 'Novak'. It sounds silly, but it is true. I try to convince myself that it's the same word."* — Novak Djokovic

He took the **Energy** of the crowd (volume, intensity) and stripped away the **Intent** (hostility). He just absorbed the raw decibels as fuel.

## Energy is Just Energy

In physics, energy is neutral. In psychology, *you* give it a charge (positive or negative).

*   Nervousness vs. Excitement? Same biological signal.
*   Booing vs. Cheering? Same volume.

The Titan does not reject energy. The Titan **transmutes** it.

## Action Step: The Reframing Drill

The next time something "bad" happens—the ref makes a bad call, the other team trash talks you—pause.

Don't ignore it. **Rewrite it.**

*   *Trash talk?* -> "He is scared of me. He needs to talk to feel brave." (Confidence boost).
*   *Bad call?* -> "The universe builds higher hurdles for the better runner." (Motivation boost).
