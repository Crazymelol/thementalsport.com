The calendar has turned. February is dead.
We do not drift into March. We attack it.

**The Audit:**
Open your training log.
1.  **Attendance:** How many sessions did you miss? Why?
2.  **Intensity:** Did you go through the motions, or did you hunt discomfort?
3.  **Recovery:** Did you sleep?

**Grading:**
Give yourself a letter grade (A-F) for February.
Be honest. If you lie to yourself, you stay average.

If you got an F, good. Fix it in March.
If you got an A, careful. Do not get comfortable.
