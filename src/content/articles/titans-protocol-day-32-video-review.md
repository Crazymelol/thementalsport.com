The camera doesn't lie.
That's why most athletes hate it.
In your head, you moved like a ninja. On video, you looked slow and stiff.

## The Disassociation Technique

When you watch yourself, your Ego screams: *"I look stupid!"*
You need to kill the Ego.
**Pretend you are watching a stranger.**
*"That player in the number 10 jersey. What is he doing wrong?"*

By removing "Me" from the equation, you can see the mechanics.
*"His footwork is flat."*
*"He isn't scanning the field."*

## What to Look For (The Checklist)
1.  **Off-Ball Movement:** What are you doing when you *don't* have the ball? (This is 90% of the game).
2.  **Body Language:** Do you look tired? Do you look defeated after a mistake?
3.  **Decision Speed:** Are you hesitating?

Don't watch for highlights. Highlights are for Instagram. Watch for mistakes. Mistakes are for growth.
