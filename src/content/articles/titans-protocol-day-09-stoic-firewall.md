Imagine you have a battery with 100 units of energy.
*   You spend 20 units being mad at the referee.
*   You spend 20 units worrying about the rain.
*   You spend 20 units wondering what the crowd thinks.

You now have 40 units left to actually play the game. Your opponent, who ignored all that, has 100.

**You lose.**

## The Circle of Control

The ancient Stoics (and modern sports psychologists) divide the world into two buckets:

### 1. Externals (Not Up To You)
*   The weather.
*   The referee's calls.
*   The opponent's skill level.
*   Luck.

### 2. Internals (Up To You)
*   Your effort.
*   Your preparation.
*   Your attitude.
*   Your reaction.

## The Firewall

A "Stoic Firewall" is a mental filter. When something happens, you ask: *"Do I control this?"*
*   **No?** Block it. Ignore it. It doesn't exist.
*   **Yes?** Attack it. Fix it.

## Action Step: The Post-Game Audit

After your next game, look at your emotions.
Did you get angry because you missed a shot? (Good—that's internal. Fix your shot).
Did you get angry because the ref was blind? (Bad—that's external. You wasted energy).

**Build the firewall. Save your battery for the war.**

**Tomorrow:** What doing when you break (The Injury Reset).
