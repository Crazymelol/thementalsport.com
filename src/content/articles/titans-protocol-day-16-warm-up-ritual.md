The Warm-Up is not just about heating up muscles. That is the amateur definition.
For the Professional, the Warm-Up is about **Transitioning Identity.**

You are crossing a bridge.
*   **Side A:** You are "Normal You." Nice, polite, worried about taxes, loves your dog.
*   **Side B:** You are "Competitor You." Cold, efficient, violent (if necessary), focused only on the task.

The Warm-Up is the bridge. You don't just "get loose." You **shed your skin.**

## Stage 1: General Activation (The Body)
*   **Goal:** Increase core temperature. Synovial fluid lubrication.
*   **Action:** Jogging, skipping, biking. Nothing specific. Just movement.
*   **Mental State:** Loose. You can still listen to a podcast here.

## Stage 2: Specific Activation (The Nervous System)
*   **Goal:** Prime the neural pathways.
*   **Action:** Now we simulate the event.
    *   *Runner:* High knees, A-skips, Strides.
    *   *Boxer:* Shadow boxing, pad work.
    *   *Coder/Gamer:* Typing drills, reaction tests.
*   **The Glaze:** You must break a sweat. If you aren't sweating, your cooling system isn't online. A dry engine breaks; a lubricated engine performs.

## Stage 3: The Race Pace Touch
*   **Goal:** Tell the brain *"We are going THIS fast today."*
*   **Action:** Short bursts of intensity.
    *   Do not exhaust yourself.
    *   Do 10-15 seconds at **105% intensity.**
    *   This is called **Post-Activation Potentiation (PAP).** It recruits the high-threshold motor units.

## Stage 4: The Anchor Trigger (The Switch)

This is the most powerful tool in the book.
Pavlov proved that if you ring a bell every time you feed a dog, eventually the dog salivates just at the sound of the bell.
We can do the same for Flow State.

**You need a "Trigger Action."**
This is a physical gesture that you **ONLY** do right before you perform. You never do it in practice. You never do it at home.

**Examples:**
*   *Tightening your shoelaces super tight.*
*   *Two slaps to the chest.*
*   *Three sharp inhales through the nose.*
*   *Pouring water over your head.*

Over time (if you pair this with high performance), your brain associates this action with **"It is time to kill."**
It cuts through the doubt. It signals the Amygdala to shut up.

## Stage 5: The Armor
Putting on your competition uniform is the final step.
When the jersey goes on, the "Nice Guy" stays in the locker room.
The person wearing the jersey does not have doubts. They have a job.
You are now a machine.
