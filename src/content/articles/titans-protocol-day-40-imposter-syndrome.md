You walk into the locker room / boardroom. You look around. Everyone else looks confident. Everyone else belongs.
You feel like a child wearing a costume.
*"I tricked them into letting me in."*

**The Pluralistic Ignorance:**
Here is the secret: **Everyone else feels the same way.**
That guy who looks super confident? He is terrified. He is just acting.

**Confidence is not the absence of doubt. It is the action in spite of it.**
You don't need to "feel" like you belong. You just need to do the work that someone who belongs would do.
Fake it until you become it. Biology follows behavior.
