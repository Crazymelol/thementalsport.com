We have spent 12 days downloading the operating system of the world's greatest athletes.
*   We learned to reframe fear (GSP).
*   We signed the contract (Kobe).
*   We spoke the truth (Ali).
*   We visualized the disaster (Phelps).

But reading about pushups doesn't make you strong.

## Information vs. Integration

The danger of self-help articles is that they give you a dopamine hit. You *feel* productive because you read about being a Titan.
But unless these tools leave the screen and enter your blood, nothing changes.

## The "New Standard"

A Standard is not a goal.
*   **Goal:** "I want to win state."
*   **Standard:** "I never miss a Monday workout. I never whine about the ref. I always visualize before bed."

Goals are for the future. Standards are for **right now**.

## Action Step: The Protocol Loop

You don't need to do everything at once. Pick **ONE** tool from this series that resonated with you.
*   Is it the Breathing?
*   Is it the Playlist?
*   Is it the "So What" Stoic drill?

Commit to that **one thing** for 30 days. Master it. Then add another.

You have the tools. You have the blueprint. The rest is just work.
**Go do the work.**
