The referee is blind. The referee hates you. The referee has money on the other team.
**It does not matter.**

When a bad call happens, you have two choices:
1.  **The Victim:** You throw your hands up. You scream. You look at your coach.
    *   *Result:* Your cortisol spikes. Your focus shifts from "The Game" to "The Injustice." You are now fighting two opponents: The other team, and the Ref. You will lose.
2.  **The Stoic:** You accept the reality. The call is made. It cannot be un-made.

## The Protocol: "Good."

Jocko Willink says: *"When things go wrong, say 'Good.' It gives us an opportunity to get better."*
*   Bad call? **Good.** It forces me to play so well that the ref can't cheat me.
*   Missed penalty? **Good.** It tests my emotional control.

## The "Stoic Nod"

Train your reaction. When a bad call hits:
1.  Take one deep breath.
2.  Look the ref in the eye (not aggressively, just calmly).
3.  Nod once.
4.  Reset.

This terrifies opponents. They expect you to break. When you don't, they wonder: *"Why is he so calm? What does he know that I don't?"*
