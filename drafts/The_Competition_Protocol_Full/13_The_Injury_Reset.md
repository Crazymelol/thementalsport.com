# Chapter 13: The Injury Reset

*Note: This is an "Emergency Chapter." You may not need it now. But if you stay in the game long enough, you will.*

The hardest part of sports is not the training. It is the **Not Training.**
When an athlete gets injured, they don't just lose their physical ability. They lose their **Identity.**
*"I am a runner. I cannot run. Therefore, I am... nothing."*

This leads to the "Identity Crash"—depression, aimlessness, and eventually, poor rehabilitation choices (rushing back too soon).

## The "Active Patient" Mindset

You are not "out of the game." You have simply switched sports.
You are no longer a Runner. You are now a **Professional Rehabber.**

Your new sport is "Healing."
*   **The Training:** Physical Therapy (PT) exercises.
*   **The Nutrition:** Anti-inflammatory diet.
*   **The Sleep:** Massive doses of growth hormone via deep sleep.

If you attack Rehab with the same intensity you attacked Training, you will recover faster. If you treat Rehab as "waiting," you will rot.

## The Visualization Protocol (Mirror Neurons)

Neuroscience tells us that visualizing movement stimulates the same neural pathways as doing the movement.
**Mirror Neurons** fire when you watch someone do a skill, or when you imagine it.
*   **SOP:** If you have a broken leg, spend 20 minutes a day closely improving the visualization of yourself running perfectly.
*   Studies show that athletes who visualize during injury lose less muscle atrophy and maintain neural sharpness compared to those who don't.

## The Comeback Trap

When you are cleared to return, you will have the "Expectation of Magic" (Chapter 1) again.
You will remember your *old* PRs. You will try to hit them on Day 1.
You will get hurt again.

**The Rule of 10%:**
Never increase volume or intensity by more than 10% per week.
Check your ego at the door. You are a rookie again. Build the base.

**Exercise 1: Re-Framing Identity**
If you cannot compete, who are you?
*   I am not just an athlete. I am also:

    2.  ________________ (e.g., A mentor to teammates)
    3.  ________________ (e.g., Disciplined in all areas)

**Exercise 2: The Rehab Schedule**
Treat PT like practice.
*   PT Session Time: _______________
