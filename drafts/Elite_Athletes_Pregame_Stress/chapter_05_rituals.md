## The Psychology of Rituals

Rituals aren't superstition—they're psychological anchors that trigger your performance state.

**Sport:** Tennis  
**Grand Slam Titles:** 23

**Serena's Rituals:**

**1. The Five-Bounce Serve**
Before every first serve, Serena bounces the ball exactly five times. This ritual:
- Creates consistency
- Triggers muscle memory
- Provides a moment to reset mentally
- Signals readiness to her brain

**2. The Lucky Socks**
Wears the same socks throughout a tournament if she's winning. When she loses, she changes them.

**3. Pre-Match Visualization**
Visualizes successful points and winning moments before stepping on court.

**Why It Works:**
These rituals create a sense of control in an uncontrollable environment. They're psychological anchors that say, "I've done this before. I'm ready."
