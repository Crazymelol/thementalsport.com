### CASE STUDY: Michael Phelps - The Visualization Master

**Sport:** Swimming  
**Olympic Medals:** 28 (23 gold)

**The Technique:**
Michael Phelps didn't just visualize winning—he visualized everything that could go wrong and how he'd handle it.

**Phelps' Visualization Protocol:**
1. **Perfect Race Scenario** - Visualized every stroke, turn, and finish
2. **Failure Scenarios** - Imagined goggles filling with water, false starts, competitors ahead
3. **Recovery Plans** - Mentally rehearsed how to overcome each challenge

**The Famous Example:**
At the 2008 Beijing Olympics, Phelps' goggles filled with water during the 200m butterfly final. He couldn't see anything. But he had visualized this exact scenario hundreds of times. He counted his strokes, executed his turns by feel, and won gold—setting a world record while swimming blind.

**How to Apply It:**
- Spend 10-15 minutes daily visualizing your performance
- Include all sensory details: sights, sounds, feelings
- Visualize both success AND potential problems
- Mental rehearse your response to adversity
